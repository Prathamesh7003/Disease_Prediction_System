# Disease_Prediction_System
This repp contains project on Disease Prediction  System done using Data Mining Techniques

This Project generally predicts the disease on the basis of user input symptoms, where it does preprocessing on the symptoms entered and then predicts using data mining technique - Logistic Regression.

Other Data mining Techniues tested on is SVM, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, etc and then model is trained using this techniques and based upon the dataset accuracy the best model is selected as the best suited model on the basis of which it predicts the disease based upon the entered symptoms.

The dataset contains 261 types of diseases and almost 490+ symptoms
